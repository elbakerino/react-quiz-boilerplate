## Scripts

    npm i
    npm start
    # open: localhost:4044
    
    npm run build
    npm serve
    # open: localhost:4046
    
To use in own libraries install dependencies and copy the src folder into your project:

    npm i --save clsx immutable react-uid
    # only used in SurveyGen:
    npm i --save react-animate-height

## Components

### Survey Basics

The files in [src/Survey](./src/Survey) are the base files for rendering and storing the questions and answers.

#### SurveyStore

- `createSurvey()` creates the immutable record `SurveyStore`
- `SurveyStore` holds the state and state updater/answers
- `SurveyProvider` with props:
    - `store: SurveyStore` the returned value of `createSurvey()`   
        - `store.values` the immutable [OrderedMap](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/OrderedMap/OrderedMap) which stores the answers
        - `store.values.toJS()` to convert back to JS-object
        - Note: if your app requires high performance, you may need to avoid toJS()
        - `store.onChange(id, value)` to update with a hard coded value
        - `store.onChange(id, oldvalue => { return newvalue })` to get the old value from the onchange handler (recommended)
        - `store.getValue(id)` to get the value of a single answer
    - `types: {}`, the types available for questions
    - `questions: []`, all questions for this survey
- `useSurvey()` hook to get the store, types and questions

#### SurveyQuestion

- `QuestionRenderer`, the universal renderer for one question
    - `type` determines the handler for the question
    - `showIf` basic "show when that" logic handler
    - `Wrapper` component that should wrap any component, like the `showIf` handler in `SurveyGen`
    - and any other prop that the actual question handler should receive
    
#### Implementing Custom Survey

Two ready-to-use survey implementations are included in the boilerplate: [SurveyGen](#survey-generator-surveygen) and [SurveyTable](#survey-table). They handle/show the survey in different ways and support different question types through multiple question handler.

With the base components you can create any own handler, take a look in [src/SurveyGen/SurveyGen](./src/SurveyGen/SurveyGen.tsx) and [src/SurveyTable/SurveyTable](./src/SurveyTable/SurveyTable.tsx) for how this can be done.

### Question Handler

Each implementation needs it's question type handlers, the basic data/properties are defined in the [QuestionProps](./src/Survey/SurveyQuestion.tsx) interface.

An minimal question in JSON:
```json
{
    "id": "fav_num_select2",
    "label": "How many children do you have?",
    "type": "number"
}
```

### Survey Table

See [src/DemoTable.tsx](./src/DemoTable.tsx) for a basic question schema and basic setup using portals.

- `HandlerRadio`
- `HandlerYesNo`

### Survey Generator (SurveyGen)

See [src/DemoGen.tsx](./src/DemoGen.tsx) for a basic question schema and basic setup using portals.

- `HandlerCheck` showing multiple checkboxes, saving selected as an array
    - additional properties
        - `values?: string[]` defines the checkboxes/values
- `HandlerNumber`
    - additional properties
        - `min?: number`
        - `max?: number`
        - `showMoreThen?: boolean`
- `HandlerRadio`
    - additional properties
        - `values?: string[]` defines the checkboxes/values
- `HandlerRating` basic handler number rating, can be used to display anything else as rating, like icons
    - additional properties
        - `min: number` the start number for the rating
        - `count: number` how many numbers can be rated
        - `CompActive` react component
        - `CompStandard` react component
- `HandlerRatingEmoji` 
    - additional properties
        - `min: number` the start number for the rating
        - `count: number` how many numbers can be rated 
- `HandlerRatingHeart`
    - additional properties
        - `min: number` the start number for the rating
        - `count: number` how many numbers can be rated
- `HandlerRatingStar`
    - additional properties
        - `min: number` the start number for the rating
        - `count: number` how many numbers can be rated 
- `HandlerString`
    - additional properties
        - `multiline` will render a `textarea`
